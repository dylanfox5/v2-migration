                        I'm a strong advocate for serving others; choosing to have
                        the humility to put others first and care for others. A good leader must first be a good follower.
                        These are the foundations of <span>leadership</span>.

                        Continuously inventing and reinventing how I can serve others & society. The term
                        Futurist is one I often use to describe myself. The future and its possibilities excite me.

                        I find nothing short of beautiful. The leaders that bring forth our future and open its 
                        possibilities are nothing without the vision of <span>problem-solving</span>.

                        This is the ideology I live each day by. Be sure to continue on or follow me on any social media
