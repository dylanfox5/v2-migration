                        I'm a strong advocate for serving others; choosing to have
                        the humility to put others first and care for others. A good leader must first be a good follower.
                        These are the foundations of <span>leadership</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Continuously inventing and reinventing how I can serve others & society. The term
                        Futurist is one I often use to describe myself. The future and its possibilities excite me.
                        I think our potential as humans are limitless when <span>innovation</span> is at the forefront.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The art of understanding an obstacle, how it works, and how it can be overcome, is one
                        I find nothing short of beautiful. The leaders that bring forth our future and open its 
                        possibilities are nothing without the vision of <span>problem-solving</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the ideology I live each day by. Be sure to continue on or follow me on any social media
                        to see what that looks like. ðŸš€
